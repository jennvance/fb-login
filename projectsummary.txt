1. User logs in with FB (done)
1.5 User logs in with email/password
2. Author goes to "find a beta reader" page and describes:
	-working title
	-genre
	-brief synopsis
	-preferred demographic
	-non-writer reader vs reader who is also a writer



3. Author hits enter, and site immediately displays all Readers who match their preferred demo.

4. Readers should be allowed to select FAVORITE genres as well as kind they're merely "willing to read".... maybe??
4.5 So have..."top matches" and "we also recommend" ????

5. Once Author selects a reader, she pays, money gets put into reader's account BUT READER CAN'T ACCESS UNTIL HAS SUBMITTED FEEDBACK TO THE AUTHOR

6. Author uploads manuscript at the time of payment, plus specific questions to ask Beta reader in addition to our generic feedback form.

7. Reader receives manuscript, plus specific instructions on how to proceed, plus timeline for producing feedback.

8. Reader writes feedback. (Use service that allows notes to be written in margins of manuscript??)

9. Author receives it, then rates the quality of the feedback. (This is dangerous, bc honest negative feedback might be punished with poor ratings)

10. Feedback is...not made public? And only used to decide whether to recommend a reader in the future....?
